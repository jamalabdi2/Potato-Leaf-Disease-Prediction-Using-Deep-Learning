# Potato Leaf Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project aims to classify potato leaf diseases using deep learning techniques. 
We will be using the 'plant-village dataset', which is available on Kaggle [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).

# Overview

This project aims to classify images of potato leaves into one of three categories:

1. Early Blight
2. Late Blight
3. Healthy
The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to train a model to classify the images.

# Prerequisites

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

1. opendatasets
2. split-folders
3. numpy
4. pandas
5. tensorflow
6. matplotlib
7. seaborn
8. scikit-learn
9. keras
